          We woke up early and prepared for our trek up the Sealy Tarns Track. The track is a strenuous climb up a series of steep steps, but the views from the top are worth it. We saw panoramic views of the mountains, including Mount Cook, and took plenty of photos along the way. At the top, we were rewarded with stunning views of the Sealy Tarns, which are small alpine lakes. We took a break to catch our breath and enjoy the scenery before descending back down the track.

In the afternoon, we visited the Tasman Glacier, the largest glacier in New Zealand. We took a boat tour to get up close to the glacier and were amazed by its sheer size. The guide told us about the history and formation of the glacier and we learned a lot about the unique ecosystem of the park. We returned to our campsite tired but happy after a long day of hiking and exploring.

Stay tuned for the next part of our camping trip in Mount Cook National Park!
